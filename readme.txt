Before attempting to run my SIS Application:

1. Execute all query first, inside the db-setup-query folder to your Microsoft SQL Sever.

2. Modify all Sql connection string path and also CrystalReport string path.

3. Set username and password to the Admin table, so that you can login.

Have CrystalReport problem, cannot view all entire record.
